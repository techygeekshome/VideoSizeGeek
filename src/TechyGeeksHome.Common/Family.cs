// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  THE TECHYGEEKSHOME FAMILY LIST
//
//  Canonical copy: PDFGeek repo, src/TechyGeeksHome.Common/Family.cs
//
//  The Geek range is spread across four stacks - Avalonia (PDFGeek, DiskGeek,
//  CutGeek, TranscribeGeek, SoundGeek, AuthGeek, VideoSizeGeek, MetaRestoreGeek), WPF (AppGeek), Go +
//  WebView2 (Ultimate Settings Panel) and Python (ReelGeek, ShortGeek, LingoGeek) - so
//  there is no single assembly every app can reference. This file is therefore
//  carried in each .NET repo, byte-identical apart from the namespace on the
//  line below. It contains no framework types precisely so that stays true.
//  The Python apps are not .NET and carry the same list in their own source.
//
//  WHEN THE RANGE CHANGES: edit the canonical copy, then copy this file into
//  every other app repo. Do not edit one in isolation - that is exactly how the
//  WordPress plugins ended up with five different "our other plugins" lists.
//
//  Keep it in step with the hub page at techygeekshome.info/geek-tools/, which
//  is what a visitor sees. The blurbs below are that page's own wording.
//
//  APPLICATIONS ONLY. This list is rendered as a row of buttons in the About
//  window, one per app, each opening that app's own page on the website. Things
//  that are not our software - the Java 8 MSI archive, for one - do not belong
//  in it, however much they live on the same site.
